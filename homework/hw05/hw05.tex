\myitem{CSCI 342, Fall 2017, Homework \# 5}

\myitem{Due date:}  Friday, December 1, midnight.  ZIP all files
together, including images and other resources.

\myitem{Instructions:}

\begin{itemize}
\item
First, follow the instructions found here to build a popup penguin game
using just HTML and CSS:

\centerline{\url{https://googlecreativelab.github.io/coder-projects/projects/pop_up_penguins/}}

\item Now modify the program and add Javascript (Vanilla or jQuery)
  to accomplish the first two ``Bonus Rounds'' as follows.

\item For this assignment, use the Javascript DOM as much as possible.
  Use the {\tt createElement} procedures and not the {\tt innerHTML}
  field.  Avoid printing HTML tags. Create objects and attach them as
  children to existing objects in the page.

\item Use Javascript arrays and for-loops to populate the page with
  penguins instead of hard coding every penguin in HTML.  This will
  allow you to put any number of penguins on the page.

\item Choose the position of the Yeti with a random number.  Every
  time you play the game it will be in a different position.
  
\item Add a dropdown box at the top of the page to choose the number
  of penguins (+ Yeti) in the game.  This will be an integer between 2
  and 64. Construct this dropdown in javascript, and use a loop to add
  all the numbers.  As soon as the user selects a new number, the new
  game should load (no submit button). 

\item Make the penguins stay up when clicked, and disappear when the
  Yeti is awoken.

\item Optional:  add real squawks, chirps, and roars.  

\end{itemize}
